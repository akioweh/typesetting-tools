# Custom Microsoft Word document Template

This aims to mirror the latex style provided by `akiotex.cls` as much as possible, but in MS Word.
Oh actually the margins are still those defaults of `article.cls` (which are a bit larger than in `akiotex.cls`).

There's defined styles for the title page, ToC, headers, captions, bibliography, equations, tables, and algorithm environments (disguised from a table).
(and maybe more that I forgot).


## Fonts

Getting this right can be **very** annoying.
But, use CMU Serif for the main text, and NewComputerModernMath for equations.
They can be found as opentype fonts on CTAN.

One of the problems is that Word sometimes likes to revert the equation font to Cambria Math... just check again yourself.

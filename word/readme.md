# Custom Microsoft Word document Template

This aims to mirror the latex style provided by `akiotex.cls` as much as possible, but in MS Word.
Oh actually the margins are still those defaults of `article.cls` (which are a bit larger than in `akiotex.cls`).

There's defined styles for the title page, ToC, headers, captions, bibliography, equations, tables, and algorithm environments (disguised from a table).
(and maybe more that I forgot).
